As a developer I often need to throw together a basic HTML + JS + CSS page to test or prototype some idea.

There's a `< 1k` stylesheet for basic HTML styles and a separate `3.2k` one for buttons, forms etc.

These minimal stylesheets get us one step beyond `Times New Roman` to make a basic HTML page or web app look non-terrible.

The stylesheets are design so that the result looks basically the same across different devices.

### Tips

 * Set the `font-size` on `body` to scale up or down the whole interface.
 * Do a search and replace of `#f56a6a` to theme it with your own color.
