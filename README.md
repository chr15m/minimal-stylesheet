Minimal stylesheets for a basic HTML page or web app to not look terrible.

Looks basically the same across different devices.

There's a `< 1k` stylesheet for basic HTML styles and a separate `3.2k` one for forms etc.

### Tips

 * Set the `font-size` on `body` to scale up or down the whole interface.
 * Do a search and replace of `#f56a6a` to theme it with your own color.
